# msRewards
This Python script use the selenium library to perform edge research and earn points in Microsoft Rewards.
P.S. In order for this script to run correctly you have to set the Edge account where you want to earn points as the default profile.
I included the edgedriver.exe file in the repository. However here's the link to the ufficial download page: https://developer.microsoft.com/it-it/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/

Requirements:
Install Selenium (see more at https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html)
Have the right Edgedriver version (see more at https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
Change the variables at the beginning of the file (mostly the Chrome User Profile Path )

Feel free to change parts of the code if you want :)
